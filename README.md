****Spotify Recommendation System****

**Description**

This project implements a content-based music recommendation system that recommends songs based on audio features and metadata, such as:

**Audio Features**: Tempo, energy, danceability, valence, acousticness, and more.
**Metadata**: Song name, artist, and other attributes.

**Algorithms Used**

k-NN with Cosine Similarity:
Finds similar songs by comparing feature vectors using cosine similarity.
Uses k-Nearest Neighbors to recommend the top k most similar songs.

Autoencoders:
A neural network model trained to compress and reconstruct song features.
Generates a latent representation of songs, which is used to recommend songs with similar latent features.
The recommendations from autoencoders often yield results that are more feature-aligned with the target song.

**How It Works**

The system analyzes a song's audio features and compares them to other songs in the dataset to generate recommendations. The user can choose between two approaches for recommendations: k-NN or autoencoders.

**Project Expansion**

To further enhance this project, a real-time streaming environment can be added using Kafka:
Real-Time Streaming Setup
The recommendation system in a streaming environment will work as follows:
Input: A user selects a song.

**Process:**
The song's ID or feature vector is sent to a Kafka topic.
A Kafka consumer listens to this topic and retrieves the song's details.
The recommendation engine (running on a server or cloud) processes the data and generates a list of similar songs in real time.
The recommendations are sent to another Kafka topic or made available via an API.

Output: The recommended songs are displayed to the user through the interface.

**Tools and Frameworks for Expansion**

Kafka: For real-time data streaming.
API Development: To expose recommendations to the user interface.
Cloud Services: AWS, GCP, or Azure to host the recommendation engine and streaming infrastructure.
Frontend: A simple web or mobile app to display recommendations.


**Results**

The k-NN approach provides fast and interpretable results.
The autoencoder-based approach yields recommendations that are closer to the target song in terms of audio features.

**Contributing**

Future Enhancements

Integration with Spotify API: Fetch live song data and metadata for personalized recommendations.

User Profiles: Build collaborative filtering-based recommendations by incorporating user listening history.

Scalability: Deploy on cloud infrastructure with support for millions of users.

Advanced Models: Explore transformer-based or deep learning approaches for feature extraction and recommendation.
